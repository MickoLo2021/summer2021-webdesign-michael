Sample Portfolio Example 

Exanple 1 Portfolio Webpages: 
https://www.derekboateng.com/

I like the color match for background and font on this webpage. It used light color as background and dark color for font. Also, It had a handshake emoji to represent hello. It had some links to connect other webpages. However, I dislike font size of header and body paragraph. Also, It has one page to show his experiences and projects. It had less images on the webpage.

I like this webpage because it is nice and clean. It had harizontal navigation bar to list the major nagivation page side by side. The color of the webpage is great. The good thing of the website to change opacity of the images. I think the header would be nagivation bar, main would be those three projects, and footer would be contact information on the bottom of the webpage.

I like this webpage because it was clean and enjoyable. It has multiple images of the projects on the middle of webpage. It has arrow keys to roll left or right side. I dislike this website is font size was small on the major nagivation page. It did not have any colours. It also lack of information on this webpage. I think the header would be "Katharine Peacchey" and nagivation bar and the main would be those images on the middle of the webpage. There are no footer on this webpage.
